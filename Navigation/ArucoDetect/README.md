1. `ArucoDetect.cpp` has the main source code. It detects the **pose** (position and orientation) of the ArUCO markers on the spacecraft relative to an inertial marker placed in the arena. **3D reconstruction** method is used to obtain the 3D coordinates of the marker. The rotation vectors generated by ArUCO module to calculate the **yaw angle** of spacecraft relative to the inertial marker.
